There are three types of enemy: A fast but short ranged crab enemy, a slow and long ranged enemy that fires orbs at the player, and a unkillable obstacle enemy that moves on a fixed path. 

If you want to, you can also change settings in the game by editing settings.py, here you can change the desired fps, resolution, resolution scale (res, larger numbers lower resolution scale), and the games camera sensitivy (ROTATIONSPEED) among other less important settings. For the best experiance make sure that the fps you get in the game matches that of the fps cap or the game may appear to move slowly. The easyist way to increase preformance is to plug your laptop in or make the res varible in settings a higher number such as 6 altough this will make edges jaggy. 

To run the program you must have pygame and numpy installed.
